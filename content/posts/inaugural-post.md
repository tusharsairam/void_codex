Hello there! This website is currently under construction :)

The **Void Codex**, as I like to call it, is a blog where I write about topics that interest me in general.
This blog is a supplement to my digital garden. The core difference is that my blog is comprised of structured and
chronologically linear posts that are detailed and considered complete for the most part, while the digital garden 
is a bunch of densely interconnected notes/snippets that are perpetually a WIP.
