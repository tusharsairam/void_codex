      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over this weekend, I stumbled upon this fairly &lt;a href=&#34;https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20110015369/downloads/20110015369.pdf&#34;&gt;old research paper&lt;/a&gt; by F. L. Markley et. al. from NASA. This paper dives into developing algorithms for calculating&#xA;what are called &lt;strong&gt;torque and momentum envelopes&lt;/strong&gt; for reaction wheel arrays. I figured I could spend some time reading through this paper and implementing the envelope computation in Python.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An envelope is a graph (often a 3D plot) that showcases the torque/angular momentum capabilities offered by an array of wheels&lt;/strong&gt;. Typically in much of the spacecraft we know, a minimum of 3 reaction wheels are used. One to provide torque along one axis. This is sufficient to provide precise attitude control&amp;hellip; until one of the wheels break down. Reaction wheels are unfortunately highly prone to failure and the spacecraft loses a degree of freedom when one decides to throw in the towel. This can jeopardize the science mission altogether. To reduce the chances of such failure, engineers bring a fourth wheel into the playground and rearrange the array of wheels. This introduces redundancy, so if one wheel gives up, the other three wheels will continue to provide 3-axis control. Some spacecraft even go for more, such as the Swift Gamma Ray Burst Explorer that uses 6 wheels.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello there! This website is currently under construction :)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Void Codex&lt;/strong&gt;, as I like to call it, is a blog where I write about topics that interest me in general.&#xA;This blog is a supplement to my digital garden. The core difference is that my blog is comprised of structured and&#xA;chronologically linear posts that are detailed and considered complete for the most part, while the digital garden&#xA;is a bunch of densely interconnected notes/snippets that are perpetually a WIP.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
