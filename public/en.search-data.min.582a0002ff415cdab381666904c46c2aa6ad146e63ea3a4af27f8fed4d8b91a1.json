This website is currently under construction :)\nThe Void Codex, as I like to call it, is a blog where I write about topics that interest me in general. This blog is a supplement to my digital garden. The core difference is that my blog is comprised of structured and chronologically linear posts that are detailed and considered complete for the most part, while the digital garden is a bunch of densely interconnected notes/snippets that are perpetually a WIP.\n"}]
