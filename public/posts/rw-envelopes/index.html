    <h1>Plotting Reaction Wheel Envelopes</h1>

    

    <p>Reaction wheels are momentum-storage actuators that make spacecraft <a href="https://youtu.be/PGNiXGX2nLU?si=aB0SFMN8PToa35LQ">spin around</a>. They&rsquo;re highly precise motor-driven wheels that deliver torque along one axis. To achieve
3-axis control, you&rsquo;d typically need atleast 3 of them placed orthogonally.</p>
<p>However, reaction wheels are also one of the most failure-prone ADCS components in a spacecraft due to the fact that they
have moving parts. This is why they add a fourth wheel and reconfigure all the 4 wheels in a tetrahedral arrangement. This
gives extra reliability through redundancy (if one wheel fails, the other three can still deliver 3-axis control), and when
all 4 wheels function normally, the extent of control improves.</p>
<p>I came across this <a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20110015369/downloads/20110015369.pdf">paper</a> by F. L. Markley et. al. (2009) that describes the <strong>torque/momentum envelope</strong> of a reaction wheel array. I set out to write the code for it to
visualize the envelopes myself and understand them better.</p>
